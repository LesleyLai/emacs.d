This is my own setting of Emacs.

* Usage
Put the whole directory to =~/.emacs.d=

* External packages
Installing those packages are optional.
** jedi
The anaconda-mode uses ~jedi~ library to do completion.

** tern
Run ~sudo npm install tern -g~. See [[http://ternjs.net/]] for more information about tern. We need tern for JavaScript completion. Note that tern do not work automatically, we need ~.tern-project~ file for setting in up.
